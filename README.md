#                 AirBnB clone
This part is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

## Synopsis:
        The HBNB project is an AirBnB cloning that will be executed on different levels till building an entire web application at the end of the year.
        On this level we will handle a part from the backend.

## Description:
### The console:
         create your data model
         manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
         store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

        The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.
        The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

### See the follow examples:




## Technologies Used:
